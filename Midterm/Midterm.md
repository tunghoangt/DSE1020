3. Given that there are 15 apples and 20 oranges. Out of the 9 apples that were identified, only 6 are apples and 3 are oranges. The precision and recall rate is:
  1. 6/9 and 6/15
  2. 6/15 and 9/15
  3. 6/9 and 3/9
  4. 3/9 and 6/9
4. The probability of a guessed answer being correct for this question, _P(Correct | not Know)_ is 1/4. The probability that you know the correct answer to this question, _P(Know)_, is 2/3. Also, the probability of you answer the question correctly if you know the answer, _P(Correct | Know)_, is 1. If you answer the question correctly, the conditional probability that you know the correct answer, _P (Know | Correct)_, is:
  1. 8/9
  2. 2/12
  3. 3/4
  4. 1/3
5. Exploratory Data Analysis is NOT helpful for:
  1. Providing visualization to understand interaction between statistical models
  2. Providing summary statistics for each field in the raw dataset
  3. Identifying interactions between different fields in the dataset
  4. Identifying clusters of similar observations
6. The best way to numerically represent an RGB image is to use:
  1. A vector
  2. A 2D numpy array
  3. A 3D numpy array
  4. A 4D numpy array
7. One of the reason for using lists to implement Stack instead of using &#39;list&#39; is:

1. To be able to use more functions that are not available for &#39;list&#39;
2. To improve the performance of functions Insert and Pop
3. To be able to store different value types like tuple (heterogenous)
4. None of the above (no advantage)

1. Topic modeling is not:
  1. A form of dimensionality reduction
  2. Described as a method for finding a group of words from a collection of documents
  3. A process to derive hidden pattern and structure exhibit in a document
  4. Useful for analyzing uncorrelated topics
